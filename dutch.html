                <p>My team was tasked with redesigning the Dutch Bros website to correct any issues that would negatively impact the user experience of this site. We focused on small changes that we could implement to reduce users’ frustration and lessen their time spent wandering around the page trying to find their destination. We wanted to make the site intuitive for users to encourage them to stay on the site.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">Gathering Data</h2>
                <p>We began this analysis by sending out a survey to determine who the audience for Dutch Bros is, and what website features are important to them. We found that consumers of Dutch Bros are between the ages of 18 and 27, with 62% of them being women. Most are in college and have a part time job in the food service industry. 93% of participants said they use this website to browse the menu and 43% use it to find a nearby location. When asked what features on a coffee shop website are important to them, 100% said having a menu, 81% said showing prices for items, 68% said showing nearby locations, 56% said having a rewards account, 56% said showing nutritional information, and 43% said having a way to contact customer service. Based on the information we gathered from the survey, we created personas of who our target audience is. This assisted us in narrowing down who our participants for the usability test should be.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">My Participants</h2>
                <p>We recruited participants who were between the ages of 18 and 27, and who had a part time job. They were also college students that regularly consumed caffeinated beverages. They were not required to be very familiar with Dutch Bros since we wanted to focus on bringing in new customers.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">My Methods and Results</h2>
                <p>The first method my team chose was a heuristic evaluation. We used this evaluation to determine what the tasks for our user test should be. We scored each heuristic on a scale of -1 to 1. If the site didn’t comply with the guideline at all it got a score of -1, if it somewhat complied it got a 0, and if it completely complied it got a 1. We found that six guidelines were not being met. The guidelines were related to navigation, intuitive icons, search boxes, filters, and product categories.<br> The second method we chose was a user test. We recruited six participants and gave them six tasks to complete. These were measured by the task completion and total time, the participant’s path and any errors, and key observations we made during their test.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">What Was I Right About?</h2>
                <p>I was correct to believe the icons in the navigation were unfamiliar to users. These should be replace with words to make the navigation intuitive. I was also right to replace the second menu link in the navigation header with the 'Shop Dutch' link. It was redundant to have two ways to get to the menu and most users struggled to find the shop page when the link was in the footer navigation.</p>
                <h2 class="pb-2">What Was I Wrong About?</h2>
                <p>I first believed putting the search bar above the featured drinks on the menu page would make more sense to users. My team brought up that it makes the visual hierarchy confusing and they suggested to remove the featured drinks section from the menu since it's already on the home page. This improved the look of the page and made the purpose of the search bar obvious.</p>
