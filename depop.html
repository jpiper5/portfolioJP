                <h2 class="pb-2">About This Project</h2>
                <p>Depop, an app that is used to sell or buy secondhand clothing, has recently redesigned the layout of their inbox page. As a user of Depop, I was not happy with the changes they made and I wondered if other users felt the same. I conducted an interview with another Depop seller to see how she felt about the changes. She was also frustrated with the new layout because she was missing out on important notifications. With the update, all notifications were lumped together on the same page with no option to filter them. These notifications included direct messages from other users and discount offers on items you’ve liked. She was worried she would miss out on a message about one of her items and potentially miss out on a sale. It was frustrating that she had to put in more effort to read through all of her notifications to ensure this wouldn’t happen.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">Gathering Data</h2>
                <p>During the interview we brainstormed ideas to improve the inbox page of Depop. As a seller, she valued being able to easily check her direct messages so she can respond quickly to potential buyers. She also wished she could see the offers she has sent out on a dedicated page rather than having to click each individual listing to view it. She didn’t place as much importance on seeing offers from other sellers on items that she has liked because it tends to clog up her inbox. Based on the information I gathered in this interview, I created a few user stories to determine which issues are most important to solve.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">My Participants</h2>
                <p>Depop’s main demographic is between 10 and 29 years old and around 60% of their users are women. For my user test, I recruited two participants between the ages of 18 and 29 since you have to be 18 to be a seller without a guardian. Both of my participants are interested in clothing/fashion and one is a Depop seller.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">My Methods</h2>
                <p>I chose to do a usability test for this analysis. I created my tasks for the test based on the user flow of the app. I made the user flow using the information I gathered from the interview to determine what aspects of the app are most used and important to sellers. I came up with three tasks related to navigation, direct messages, and offers to potential buyers. I measured these based on the path users took and their comments during the test.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">Results</h2>
                <p>The participants felt the navigation and layout was intuitive and even found more efficient paths than my expected path. They easily found the information they were looking for and didn’t have to use extra effort to sort through their notifications.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-2">What I Would Do Differently</h2>
                <p>If I had more time to work on this analysis, I would’ve liked to make a more high fidelity prototype with app-specific fonts and colors. I would’ve also liked to include the profile page with seller tools in my analysis, but it was beyond the scope of this project.</p>
