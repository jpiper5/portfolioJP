                    <h2>About This Project</h2>
                    <p>In a town where there is no shortage of coffee shops, it’s tough for locally owned shops like Amped to stay afloat. Well known chain coffee shops have no issue gaining customers based on name alone, but local shops don’t have a household name to fall back on. In this age, local shops need to have an online presence to bring in new customers. It’s crucial to have a website that shows who they are and what they offer to encourage potential customers to choose them over a chain. While Amped does have a website, it’s lacking information and feels unfinished. There’s no menu, a blank navigation dropdown, and it’s not optimized for mobile layout. I set out to determine if addressing these issues will make people more likely to visit Amped.</p>

                    <h2>Gathering Data</h2>
                    <p>Before conducting my analysis, I sent out a survey online to see what features of a coffee shop website are important to users. 100% of users said they would like to see a menu, 81% said they want to see prices on the menu, and 43% said they want to see contact information. I also wanted to compare Amped’s current site to other coffee shops’ sites in the area, Starbucks and Ziggi’s. When asked which site of the three they preferred most, the majority said Starbucks. Not a single participant chose Amped. The reasoning behind their choice was that Starbucks was easy to navigate, well organized, not overwhelming, and had a dropdown navigation with an option to view the menu. When asked how likely they were to visit Amped, on a scale of 1 to 5, based on the current site the average answer was 2. Users said Amped’s site didn’t have a lot of information and it was bland.</p>

                    <h2>My Participants</h2>
                    <p>The age range of participants who took the survey was 18-24 years old. Around two-thirds were women. With this information in mind, I recruited 3 participants for my user test that were within this age range. I recruited 2 women and 1 man. I chose participants that were coffee/tea drinkers that had never been to Amped before but had heard of it since my goal is to bring in new customers.</p>

                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>My Methods</h2>
                    <p>I chose to first conduct a heuristic evaluation to see if the results of the evaluation aligned with my other research. I scored each heuristic on a scale of -1 to 1. If the site didn’t comply with the guideline at all it got a score of -1, if it somewhat complied it got a 0, and if it completely complied it got a 1. I found that Amped’s site didn’t match the real world by having a menu with the food/drinks that they offer. It also didn’t follow industry standards by having prices for the items and it had a blank navigation dropdown. These results aligned with the information I gathered from users in my survey. <br> The second method I chose was usability testing. I created a prototype to test with an updated layout that was mobile friendly and added a menu page. I conducted three tests with five tasks relating to browsing the menu, contact information, and site navigation. I measured each task based on task completion, time spent on each task, errors, and users’ comments. Each task was successfully completed and the layout and navigation was intuitive to users. <br> I also considered using the card sorting method to determine the layout of the menu. However, I decided this wasn’t necessary since I could follow the layout of Amped’s menu in their physical store.</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>Each participant took the expected path on each task except for participant 1 on Task 5. She found a more efficient way to get the information she needed and finished the task 10 seconds sooner than the other participants. The participants made no errors and based on their comments, navigating the site came easy to them. After the usability test, I asked each participant five questions related to their experience. When asked how likely they were to visit Amped based on the current site, the average answer was 5. The participants preferred the updated site to the previous one because it had more information, was easy to navigate, and was more organized. I concluded the test by asking if they had any suggestions for the updated site. They said it would be nice to see more photos of inside the building and of menu items.</p>

                    <h2>What Was I Right About?</h2>
                    <p>I was correct to believe that  having a website with a menu and an intuitive navigation is crucial to bringing in new customers.</p>
                    <h2>What Was I Wrong About?</h2>
                    <p>I believed users would prefer a minimalist design so I limited the amount of photos on the site, but based on their suggestions, it seems more photos would make Amped look more inviting. It will also give them more information about the menu if they can see what the drinks look like.</p>

                    <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
                    <p>If I had more time to spend on this project, I would’ve liked to add a calendar with events that Amped hosts to see if that would help bring in new customers. I believe it could show the sense of community at Amped which could give it an advantage over big corporations who don’t prioritize that aspect. I would also like to make a separate page for the three categories of the menu so I could have more room to add photos of popular drinks.</p>
